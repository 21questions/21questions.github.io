          <br />

          <span>2. WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?</span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>
            In Short: We only share information with your consent, to comply
            with laws, to provide you with services, to protect your rights, or
            to fulfill business obligations. We may process or share your data
            that we hold based on the following legal basis:
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>
            Consent: We may process your data if you have given us specific
            consent to use your personal information for a specific purpose.
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>
            Legitimate Interests: We may process your data when it is reasonably
            necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests.
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>
            Performance of a Contract: Where we have entered into a contract
            with you, we may process your personal information to fulfill the
            terms of our contract.
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>
            Legal Obligations: We may disclose your information where we are
            legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable law,
            governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal
            process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena
            (including in response to public authorities to meet national
            security or law enforcement requirements).
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>
            Vital Interests: We may disclose your information where we believe
            it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding
            potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations
            involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal
            activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>

            business to another company.
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>3. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?</span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>
            In Short: We may transfer, store, and process your information in
            countries other than your own. Our servers are located in. If you
            are accessing our App from outside, please be aware that your
            information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in
            our facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share
            your personal information, in and other countries. If you are a
            resident in the European Economic Area, then these countries may not
            necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as
            comprehensive as those in your country. We will however take all
            necessary measures to protect your personal information in
            accordance with this privacy notice and applicable law.
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>
            In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to
            fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless
            otherwise required by law. We will only keep your personal
            information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out
            in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required
            or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal
            requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to
            process your personal information, we will either delete or
            anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for
            example, because your personal information has been stored in backup
            archives), then we will securely store your personal information and
            isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>
            In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a
            system of organizational and technical security measures. We have
            implemented appropriate technical and organizational security
            measures designed to protect the security of any personal
            information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts
            to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
            Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be
            100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers,
            cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able
            to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or
            modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect
            your personal information, transmission of personal information to
            and from our App is at your own risk. You should only access the App
            within a secure environment.
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>6. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>
            In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to
            children under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly solicit data
            from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the App,
            you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or
            guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use
            of the App. If we learn that personal information from users less
            than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the
            account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data
            from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have
            collected from children under age 18, please contact us at
            contact@21question.app.

          <br />
          <br />
          <span>7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>
            In Short: You may review, change, or terminate your account at any
            time. If you are a resident in the European Economic Area and you
            believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you
            also have the right to complain to your local data protection
            supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here:

          <span>8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>
            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
            applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you
            can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
            about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At
            this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
            implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not
            currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
            automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If
            a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
            future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version
            of this privacy notice.
          </span>

          <span>9. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>
            In Short: Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted
            specific rights regarding access to your personal information.
            California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The
            Light" law, permits our users who are California residents to
            request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge,
            information about categories of personal information (if any) we
            disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the
            names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared
            personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If
            you are a California resident and would like to make such a request,
            please submit your request in writing to us using the contact
            information provided below. If you are under 18 years of age, reside
            in California, and have a registered account with the App, you have
            the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post
            on the App. To request removal of such data, please contact us using
            the contact information provided below, and include the email
            address associated with your account and a statement that you reside
            in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed
            on the App, but please be aware that the data may not be completely
            or comprehensively removed from all our systems (e.g. backups,
            etc.).
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>10. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>
            In Short: Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay
            compliant with relevant laws. We may update this privacy notice from
            time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an “Updated"
            date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is
            accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we
            may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such
            changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you
            to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we
            are protecting your information.
