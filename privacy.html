                    <p>1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT? </p><br>

                        to opt-out from receiving these types of communications, you may turn them off in your device's
                        settings. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our
                        App, for troubleshooting and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p><br>
                    <p>2. WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?</p><br>
                    <p>In Short: We only share information with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with
                        services, to protect your rights, or to fulfill business obligations. We may process or share
                        your data that we hold based on the following legal basis:</p><br>
                    <p>Consent: We may process your data if you have given us specific consent to use your personal
                        information for a specific purpose. </p><br>
                    <p>Legitimate Interests: We may process your data when it is reasonably necessary to achieve our
                        legitimate business interests. </p><br>
                    <p>Performance of a Contract: Where we have entered into a contract with you, we may process your
                        personal information to fulfill the terms of our contract. </p><br>
                    <p>Legal Obligations: We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in
                        order to comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order,
                        or legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to
                        public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements). </p><br>
                    <p>Vital Interests: We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to
                        investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected
                        fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal
                        activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved. </p><br>
                    <p>Business Transfers: We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during
                        negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a
                        portion of our business to another company.</p><br>
                    <p>3. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?</p><br>
                    <p>In Short: We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other than your own.
                        Our servers are located in. If you are accessing our App from outside, please be aware that your
                        information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those
                        third parties with whom we may share your personal information, in and other countries. If you
                        are a resident in the European Economic Area, then these countries may not necessarily have data
                        protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. We will however
                        take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy
                        notice and applicable law.</p><br>
                    <p>4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</p><br>
                    <p>In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in
                        this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law. We will only keep your personal
                        information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice,
                        unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or
                        other legal requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
                        personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not
                        possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives),
                        then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing
                        until deletion is possible.</p><br>
                    <p>5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</p><br>
                    <p>In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and
                        technical security measures. We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational
                        security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process.
                        However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic
                        transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100%
                        secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized
                        third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or
                        modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information,
                        transmission of personal information to and from our App is at your own risk. You should only
                        access the App within a secure environment.</p><br>
                    <p>6. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS? </p><br>
                    <p>In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age. We
                        do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the
                        App, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a
                        minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the App. If we learn that personal
                        information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the
                        account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you
                        become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at
                        contact.21questions@gmail.com.</p><br>
                    <p>7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</p><br>
                    <p>In Short: You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time. If you are a resident in
                        the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal
                        information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory
                        authority. You can find their contact details here: </p><br>
                    <p>https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/items/612080</p><br>
                    <p>If you are a resident in Switzerland, the contact details for the data protection authorities are
                        available here: </p><br>
                    <p>https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html.</p><br>
                    <p>8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</p><br>
                    <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a
                        Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not
                        to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
                        uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As
                        such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
                        automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online
                        tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in
                        a revised version of this privacy notice.</p><br>
                    <p></p><br>
                    <p></p><br>
                    <p>9. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</p><br>
                    <p>In Short: Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding
                        access to your personal information. California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the
                        "Shine The Light" law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from
                        us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if
                        any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of
                        all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding
                        calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please
                        submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below. If you are
                        under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the App, you
                        have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the App. To request
                        removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below, and
                        include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in
                        California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the App, but please be aware
                        that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from all our systems (e.g.
                        backups, etc.).</p><br>
                    <p>10. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</p><br>
                    <p>In Short: Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws. We
                        may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an
                        “Updated" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make
                        material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a
                        notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review
                        this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p><br>
                    <p>10. HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</p><br>
                    <p>If you have questions or comments about this notice, you may email us at
                        contact.21questions@gmail.com or by post to: SAN ENTERTAINMENT LLC</p><br>
                    <p>11. HOW CAN YOU REVIEW, UPDATE, OR DELETE THE DATA WE COLLECT FROM YOU?</p><br>
                    <p>Based on the applicable laws of your country, you may have the right to request access to the

                        circumstances. To request to review, update, or delete your personal information, please submit
